# Data Analysis Case Study: Cyclistic Bike-Share

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Justin Shin and in this case study, I will be performing the tasks of a data analyst in order to showcase and apply the data analytic skills and knowledge I have learned.

Technologies used for this case study: 
* Microsoft Excel
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Tableau Public
* RStudio

For viewing purposes, I have broken up this case study into 7 parts:
1. **Setting** - To provide background information about the project and the company
2. **Business Task** - Identifying the business task/problem that needs to be solved and creating guiding questions
3. **Data Source** - Disclosing the datasets used and where the datasets come from
4. **Documentation** - To document the process of *data preparation*, *data cleaning*, and *data manipulation* for analysis purposes
5. **Analysis** - To document data discoveries and insights to address the business task/problem using Microsoft SQL Server and RStudio
6. **Visualization** - Creating interactive data visualizations using Tableau Public and RStudio
7. **Recommendation** - Providing the final conclusion and recommendations based off of the analysis

*Note: This analysis case study is one of the capstone project options for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, which focuses on the **fictional** bike-share company, Cyclistic.* 

## 1. Setting:
Cyclistic is a bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations throughout Chicago. Cyclistic has set itself apart from their competitors by offering a variety of options, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike.

Cyclistic is a bike-share company that features a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Included among their fleet of bicycles are traditional bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. 
The large variety of the types of bicycles offered has allowed Cyclistic to set itself apart from their competitors by making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who cannot use a standard two-wheeled bicycle.

Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy has relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: **single-ride passes**, **full-day passes**, and **annual memberships**. 
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as *casual riders*, whereas customers who purchase annual memberships are **Cyclistic Members**.

Cyclistic has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the company believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
As such, the company wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## 2. Business Task: 
**_Develop a new strategy to convert casual riders into annual members:_**

1. Understand how annual members and casual riders differ.
3. Understand why casual riders would buy an annual membership.
4. How to effectively use digital media to influence casual riders to becoming annual members.
5. Understand who the stakeholders are and who the audience is for this case study.

## 3. Data Source:
The datasets used for this project were provided by **Motivate International Inc.**. The datasets are public data that are appropriate for the purposes of this case study.

*Note: Data Privacy issues prohibit accessing rider's personally identifiable information. As such, I was unable to connect pass purhcases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders lived in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.* 

## 4. Documentation
### Data Preparation:
1. Downloaded the datasets for May 3, 2022 to June 8, 2023.
2. Created a folder to house the files from the dataset using appropriate file-naming conventions.
3. Created subfolders for the .CSV files in order to have a copy of the original dataset.
4. Converted the .CSV files to .XLS workbook files to perform data exploration and cleaning.

### Data Cleaning:

## 5. Analysis

## 6. Visualizations

## 7. Recommendations
